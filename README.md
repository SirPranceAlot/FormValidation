FormValidation
==============

Testing Javascript form validation.

These are the requirements for my project.

"Your task is to add script to this file so that when a button is clicked, a script will
perform validation tests. For instance, test with script to see whether the expiration date
is valid. If it is not, prompt the user to update that field in the form.
Test the digits entered in the Card Number field to see whether they are valid for the type
of credit card selected at the top of the form. For example:

Visa card numbers always begin with the numeral 4 and use 16 digits.

MasterCard numbers always begin with the numeral 5 and use 16 digits.

American Express card numbers always begin with the numeral 3 and use 15 digits. "
